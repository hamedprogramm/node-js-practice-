# node-js-practice-
this repository is for guys who started learning node js , in this exercise , you will see how to create a simple API in node js

at first we have a data.js file that we put some data in it and exported it :

1) we created a courses data and exported it 
2) we created a blogs data and exported it 
3) we created a users data and exported it

then we imported them in main file (Ex-3.js).
because we seted the ( type ) field in pakage.json to "module", we imported a "createRequire" because in fact , when we import "createRequire" we can use "require()"

then we declared a "port" variable then we seted it = 5000.

after that we created the server then we used some if statment
